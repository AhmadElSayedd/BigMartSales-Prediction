These are predictions made by several models for my Intro to Artificial intelligence course project, the project was a competition on kaggle.
The BEST.ipynb submission was the submission that led us to win the competition, using the SVR model to predict sales for 10 different markets.
We had to use 4 different models, that's what the rest of the models are for.
